Open Adventure is an open source, free-to-play RPG system that is similar in play-style as B/X but can play both fantasy and sci-fi games (anywhere from [LOTR][lotr] or [D&D][dnd] to [Star Wars][sw] or [Star Trek][st].

We want to re-light the lost flame of old school gaming in a new way. Instead of recreating a wheel that's already been made, we have set out to bring modern day techniques and mechanics to the games of old. Help discuss and develop the game by offering your own ideas, art and homemade rules. Together, we can all create a game we love to play!

The rulebook is written with [LibreOffice][lo]. The graphics are made with [GIMP][gimp].
